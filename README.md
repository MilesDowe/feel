# feel: A CLI happiness tracker #

A simple CLI command to track your current mood and feelings. Ideally, `feel` can provide you data on how you generally feel over time and encourage reflection on issues you overcame.

## About ##

I wanted a project to work on so I could grow familiar with Golang and to create something I may find practical for myself. I see a lot of emotion trackers, but haven't noticed one yet for the command line. So, I figure this is an alright project idea.

I'd like to see how ambitious I become with this, like understanding user input to help provide more interesting stats.
